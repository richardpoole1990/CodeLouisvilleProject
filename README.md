# CodeLouisvilleProject

Website Project for GitHub

Site made to help sell snakes for local breeder. After site loads, user can click buttons, which then uses JS to add HTML information depending on what button was selected.

Requirements:

Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way based on what type of device the project is viewed from - My site moves buttons row with text under, to column with text under.

Your project includes at least 3 custom CSS class and/or ID selectors which are applied to your HTML elements - Currently sitting at 14 disregarding media queries. 


Your project includes custom JavaScript including at least one JavaScript function - I only have one function that is repeated 4 times, but it has an even listener that when detects a button press, changes display type of an empty div to display block, and adds a blurb of information to innerHTML depending on what button was pressed.


Your code has some comments noting major portions of your code: Comments added to anything I had issues getting to work. 


Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository - https://github.com/richardpoole1990/CodeLouisvilleProject


You are highly encouraged to include a front-end framework such as AJAX, jQuery, or Angular in your project as a demonstration of your ability to utilize these. However, this is not a requirement of a passing project. I did not use any of these -.-


You are also highly encouraged to add some form of user interactivity to your project where something responds to an action the user performs. However, this is also not a requirement of passing. Button presses add HTML to web page.


Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned. - I had a blast (except for one CSS issue.....)
